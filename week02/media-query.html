            <p>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the
                right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make
                them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</p>

            <h2>Moroni 10:32</h2>
            <p>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall
                deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his
                grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye
                are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</p>
